We present here platform that let's you:
* Find a specialist that you need, with online diagnose (using API [symptomate] https://symptomate.com)
* Get schedules of treatments (from [terminy leczenia] https://api.nfz.gov.pl/#structure)
* Get your history of treatment (from [ZIP] https://zip.nfz.gov.pl)
* Rate doctors (for initialization we used [google maps] and [znany lekarz])
* Reports any abuse of possible frauds from historical treatments

Mobile app is user friendly. Runs on both android and ios. To build it we used react-native.
